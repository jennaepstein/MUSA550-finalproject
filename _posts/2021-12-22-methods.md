This page goes through the process and methods used throughout this project.

## Project Overview
Page: [Project Overview](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/overview/).

I used altair to create the contextual map and bar plot shown on the Project Overview page.


## Part 1
Page: [Exploratory Analysis: Population Density & Social Vulnerability](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part1-exploratory-analysis/).

Part 1 of this project involved conducting an exploratory analysis on demographic data (population) and social vulnerability. 

(census tract level).

I used a combination of altair and matplotlib for the various visualizations to explore spatial relationships.


## Part 2
Page: [Evaluating Accessibility with a Pandas Network Analysis](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part2-accessibility-to-centers/)

Part 2 of this project centered around a [Pandana](http://udst.github.io/pandana/) network analysis to explore walking access to evacuation centers from each intersection. Main steps included:
* Creating a pandanas network 
* Loading data for the walkable street network using [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and adding locations of the hurricane evacuation centers to the network
* Plotting the walking distance to the nearest center with a maximum distance of 2000 meters

In order to construct the plots (both the static and the interactive versions), I performed the following:
- For each point on the walking street network, used `network_nearest_poi` to obtain distances from the nodes to the nearest evacuation center.
- Merged coordinates of the network nodes with obtained distances to the nearest centers (meters)

## Part 3
Page: [Mapping the Elements Together](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part3-folium-map/)
Using the results from parts 1 and 2, I then created a folium map using Folium to showing the centers and the walkable street network.
The folium map includes a layer control toggle, allowing useres to switch between different overlays for population density and social vulnerability, as well as toggle on/off the base layers of hurricane evacuation zones (proxy for hurricane flooding and other stormwater-relate4d risks), and accessible nodes (a half mile or less from the nearest evacuation center).
