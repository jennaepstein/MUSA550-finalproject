This page goes through the process and methods used throughout this project.

## Project Overview
Page: [Project Overview](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/overview/).

The data for hurricane evacuation centers, hurricane evacuation zones, and NYC boroughs was downloaded from New York City's open data portal, [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). I performed some spatial joins to associate boroughs with centers and zones.

I used altair to create the contextual map and bar plot shown on the Project Overview page.


## Part 1
Page: [Exploratory Analysis: Population Density & Social Vulnerability](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part1-exploratory-analysis/).

Part 1 of this project involved conducting an exploratory analysis on demographic data (population) and social vulnerability. Tabular data for the population variable for each census tract - as well as the geometries for each tract - were extracted from the US Census using Cenpy. The population density variable was calculated using the total population estimate and the total land area estimate for each tract.

The social vulnerability data was downloaded from the CDC for New York State. I filtered the data down to the five counties (which correspond to the five boroughs) of New York City, performed much data cleanup, and joined this data with the census data based on unique census tract IDs.

I used a combination of altair and matplotlib for the various visualizations to explore spatial relationships.


## Part 2
Page: [Evaluating Accessibility with a Pandas Network Analysis](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part2-accessibility-to-centers/)

Part 2 of this project centered around a [Pandana](http://udst.github.io/pandana/) network analysis to explore walking access to evacuation centers from each intersection. Main steps included:
* Creating a pandanas network 
* Loading data for the walkable street network using [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and adding locations of the hurricane evacuation centers to the network
* Plotting the walking distance to the nearest center with a maximum distance of 2000 meters

In order to construct the plots (both the static and the interactive versions), I performed the following:
- For each point on the walking street network, used `network_nearest_poi` to obtain distances from the nodes to the nearest evacuation center.
- Merged coordinates of the network nodes with obtained distances to the nearest centers (meters)

## Part 3
Page: [Mapping the Elements Together](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part3-folium-map/)
Using the results from parts 1 and 2, I then created a folium map using Folium to showing the centers and the walkable street network.
The folium map includes a layer control toggle, allowing useres to switch between different overlays for population density and social vulnerability, as well as toggle on/off the base layers of hurricane evacuation zones (proxy for hurricane flooding and other stormwater-relate4d risks), and accessible nodes (a half mile or less from the nearest evacuation center).
