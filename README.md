# Final Project for MUSA-550-Fall-2021
Jenna Epstein, December 2021

## A Geospatial Analysis of Population, Social Vulnerability, and Hurricane Evacuation Center Access in NYC
For my final project, I sought to explore hurricane vulnerability in NYC through the lenses of population density, social vulnerability, and hurricane evacuation center accessibility.
In addition to the [Project Overview](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/project-overview/), the project contains three parts:
1. [Part 1: Exploratory Analysis of Population Density & Social Vulnerability](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part1-exploratory-analysis/)
2. [Part 2: Evaluating Accessibility to Hurricane Evacuation Centers](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part2-accessibility-to-centers/)
3. [Part 3: Mapping the Elements Together](https://jennaepstein.github.io/MUSA550-finalproject/part3-folium-map/)
